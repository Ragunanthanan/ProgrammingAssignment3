Identifiers:

"ActivityCode" --> Activities such as WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
,SITTING,STANDING,LAYING
 are decoded as 1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively                           
"SubjectID" --> Volunteers 1:30 are labelled uniquely.

Variables:

1. Variables are classified as two domains (Time domain variable and Frequency domain variable) with three directions X,Y,Z
2. Temperature domain has the following measurements from both accelerometer and Gyroscope
	- Triaxial acceleration (Total acceleration) and it's Magnitude
	- The estimated body acceleration.calculated from Total accelation by subtracting gravity
	- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.The units are radians/second.
	- Gravity Acceleration. The units are 'g'
	- The body acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.
		
3.Frequency domain has the following measurements from both accelerometer and Gyroscope
	- Body Acceleration and it's Magnitude
	- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.The units are radians/second
	- The body acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals

4. Variables as listed above, are summarized using Mean and Standard deviation
